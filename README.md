## App Description
CircleStories is a collaborative storytelling game. Each user can contribute an
entry to existing stories or start their own stories. When adding to stories,
you can only see the latest addition of a story and can only contribute once.
Each user will be able to read stories they have added to and see how the story
is continued by others.
